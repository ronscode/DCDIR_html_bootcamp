                        <p>Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one. I will. C'mon. Oh.</p>
        
                        <p> No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny. This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Hey boy, are you alright? Why do you keep following me around?</p>
                                
                        <p>Ahh. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Yeah. I just wanna use the phone.</p>
                        
                        <p> I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. George. Lorraine. How's your head? Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.</p>
